# We tried

1D_CNN
Bi-LSTM
LSTM

I also tried to do a mix between 1D and BILSTM but didn't work very well

# TODO

MinMax scaling and similar things
Normalization on DATASET
Dataaugmentation 
Surely much more but also considering we have less days

# RESULTS

So far the results oscillate between 0.55 and 0.67 rouhly.
People seem to be getting slightly more I am not sure using what.
Paolo said normalization doesnt boost that much BUT WE NEED STUFF TO DISCUSS FOR THE REPORT
SO LETS DO IT !
