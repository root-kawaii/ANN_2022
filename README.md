# Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning Challenges 2022

## Challenge 1

In this challenge we were required to classify species of plants (like the ones in the example image below), which are divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.

## Challenge 2 

In this challenge, we were asked to correctly classify samples in the multivariate time series format.
In other words, since this is a classification problem, the objective is to correctly map the information contained in the features calculated over time to their labels.
In the second folder you may find the dataset and our provided solution.
